classifying S&amp;P 500 companies stocks into buy/sell using LSTM 

This project focuses on utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify stocks based on historical data of S&P 500 companies. The dataset spans from 2019 to May 2023 and was obtained by scraping data using the yfinance library. By training the LSTM model on this dataset, we achieved impressive results in predicting stock movements over the last 6 months, with a mean squared percentage error (MSPE) of 0.25. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM in stock classification tasks and serves as a valuable resource for investors and analysts interested in utilizing machine learning techniques for stock prediction.
